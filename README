sysNP
(C) 2011-2012 Nathaniel Powell

Description:
sysNP is a CPU instruction set exploration project. The goal is to create a 16-bit RISC instruction set that could (theoretically) support a modern operating system, barring memory constraints. sysNP is a software implimentation of that instruction set.

Features:
* A 16-bit MIPS-inspired RISC architecture (instruction set incomplete)
* A command-by-command monitoring interface

Planned Features:
* I/O
* A clock generator to drive the CPU, in addition to the stepping interface
* TLB support for OS memory paging.
